## We develop with GitHub

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## Git Workflow

We use [Gitflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow) as our Git workflow, and all code changes happen through pull requests. Your pull requests to the codebase are very much welcome:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `develop`.
1. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
1. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
1. Ensure the test suite passes.
1. Open that pull request!

## Reporting bugs

We use [GitHub issues](https://github.com/idpass/smartscanner-core/issues) to track bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/idpass/smartscanner-core/issues/new).

Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code. An issue template is provided when opening a new issue, make sure to provide all the requested information to make it easier to address the issue.
